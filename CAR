Cyber truck:
285mm width
185.25mm height
20" diameter
 width:diameter ratio
285:508=0.561 width:diameter ratio

My tires:
25.4mm width
16.51mm height
2" diameter
1:2=0.5 width:diameter ratio

-> Match diameter so that the car looks the same proportionally
    -> Can hide the fact that the tire is not wide enough.
